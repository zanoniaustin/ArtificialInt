Branch MiniMax has second homework assignment for creating a depth parameter for the min max agent to change difficulty.

Branch cache seperated from MiniMax branch. The cache branchs caches values while it is doing the depth search increasing the speed of the speed of the depth serach. Main changes are to [MinMaxAgent.py](https://github.com/zanoniaustin/ArtificialInt/blob/cache/tictactoes/MinMaxAgent.py) and to [Game.py](https://github.com/zanoniaustin/ArtificialInt/blob/cache/tictactoes/Game.py).

Branch steepestDescent has these 3 java files that implements the gradient descent for the [EggHolder Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization) and the [Three Hump Camel Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization). It properly works for the camel function since it is more flat. It however doesn't find the min for the eggholder because it is to bumpy, even with running it through the gradient descent and steepest descent functions. [EggHolder.java](https://github.com/zanoniaustin/ArtificialInt/blob/steepestDesent/steepestdescent/EggHolder.java) [Main.java](https://github.com/zanoniaustin/ArtificialInt/blob/steepestDesent/steepestdescent/Main.java) [ThreeHumpCamel.java](https://github.com/zanoniaustin/ArtificialInt/blob/steepestDesent/steepestdescent/ThreeHumpCamel.java)

Final Project: Adventure game in Prolog that has AI given to the king where he can be intimidated, scared, or surrender depending on how many things you have done before getting to him. i.e. Getting weapons or freeing prisoners.
