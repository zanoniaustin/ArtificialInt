Branch steepestDescent has these 3 java files that implements the gradient descent for the [EggHolder Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization) and the [Three Hump Camel Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization). It properly works for the camel function since it is more flat. It however doesn't find the min for the eggholder because it is to bumpy, even with running it through the gradient descent and steepest descent functions.
